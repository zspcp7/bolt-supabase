### Fixed - 2025-01-27

#### Critical RLS Policy Fix for User Profile Creation
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20250706144035_bold_firefly.sql`  
**Author:** Assistant  
**Type:** Bug Fix - Critical  
**Priority:** High - Blocks user registration

**Changes Made:**
- **Line 1-6:** Added initial INSERT policy `"Allow authenticated users to create their own profile"` for `public.users` table
  - Allows authenticated users to insert records where `id = auth.uid()`
  - Addresses RLS violation error during user signup process

- **Line 8-16:** Added enhanced INSERT policy `"Allow profile creation during signup"` 
  - Includes email verification check: `email = (SELECT email FROM auth.users WHERE id = auth.uid())`
  - Ensures profile creation aligns with Supabase Auth user data

- **Line 18-19:** Dropped initial policy to prevent conflicts
  - Removes `"Allow authenticated users to create their own profile"` policy
  - Prevents duplicate policy errors

- **Line 21-28:** Created final comprehensive INSERT policy `"Users can create their own profile"`
  - Combines user ID verification (`id = auth.uid()`) 
  - Adds email consistency check with Supabase Auth
  - Replaces previous policies with single, robust solution

**Root Cause:**
- Missing INSERT permission in RLS policies for `public.users` table
- Users could authenticate via Supabase Auth but couldn't create corresponding profile records
- Error: `"new row violates row-level security policy for table "users""`

**Expected Impact:**
- ‚úÖ **Positive:** User registration flow now completes successfully
- ‚úÖ **Positive:** Profile creation works for all authentication methods
- ‚úÖ **Positive:** Maintains security by ensuring users can only create their own profiles
- ‚úÖ **Positive:** Email consistency enforced between Auth and profile tables

**Potential Side Effects:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Monitor:** Ensure no duplicate profile creation attempts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Monitor:** Verify email synchronization between auth.users and public.users
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Test:** Confirm policy works with social authentication providers

**Testing Requirements:**
- üîç **Critical:** Test complete signup flow (email/password)
- üîç **Critical:** Verify profile creation with email verification enabled/disabled
- üîç **Important:** Test with different user roles
- üîç **Important:** Verify existing users are not affected

**Database Schema Impact:**
- No structural changes to tables
- Only RLS policy modifications
- Backward compatible with existing data

**Security Considerations:**
- Policy ensures users can only create profiles for their own authenticated identity
- Email verification prevents profile creation with mismatched email addresses
- Maintains principle of least privilege
